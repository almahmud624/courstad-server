I've been working on the lessons in this English course for over 10 years, and have seen them help many students master the key skills they need to really understand how to use English at a high level. This course contains everything you need to start using the English language naturally, and feel confident in your English skills. The course will guide you step-by-step. Also, each lesson is filled with natural English examples, which is the best way to learn.Each section of the course includes an assignment so that you can practice everything you learn. This is really essential! Input is great, but if you're not using the English language as you learn, it won't stick. The course starts out with an intensive focus on how to describe things clearly in English. Explore the examples other students have made (along with my feedback) in addition to adding your own."
